### Attributes.

* border => Draw a border of an item.
* border-style => Change the border type.
* width => Change the width of an element.
* height => Change the height of an element.

### Classes.

Classes are used to identify elements from a HTML file. Using classes, you can set the same class for many other elements.

* They are declared: `class="name-class"`.
* Inside stylesheet file: `.name-class{ attribute }`

### ID's.

An ID is very similar to classes. You can use ID's in order to identify elements but, insetead of classes, you can use them one for each element.

* They are declared: `id="name-id"`.
* Inside stylesheet file: `#name-id{ attribute }`.

## Favicon.

In order to create a pixel icon, you can visit https://favicon.cc 
Once you create your own icon, you have to download and save it into the project. For example:

* `<link rel="icon" href="../assets/media/favicon.ico">`.
